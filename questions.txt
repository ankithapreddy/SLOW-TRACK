What is a disk?
Disk is a hard round magnetic plate which is cappable of storing an information and we can edit it whenever we want that we can
write in it as many times we want.
The information which is stored or saved in a disk is processed or read by a preprocessor program which processes the program.
Preprocessor program is a program which processes the input given to it and gives the relavent output.
Next comes the compiler the compiler creates an object code and stores it again on the disk.
What is an object code?
Object code is the output of a compiler after it processes source code. Source code is
the version of a computer program as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer)
by a human in a programming language. A compiler is a specialized program that converts source code into object code.
