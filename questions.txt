Editor is a person who creates a program. He creates a program and stores it in a disk.
What is a disk?
Disk is a hard round magnetic plate which is cappable of storing an information and we can edit it whenever we want that we can
write in it as many times we want.
The information which is stored or saved in a disk is processed or read by a preprocessor program which processes the program.
Preprocessor program is a program which processes the input given to it and gives the relavent output.
Next comes the compiler the compiler creates an object code and stores it again on the disk.
What is an object code?
Object code is the output of a compiler after it processes source code. Source code is
the version of a computer program as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer)
by a human in a programming language. A compiler is a specialized program that converts source code into object code.
Compiler takes the code or the input which we give to the computer which is called the source code then it processes the program
and gives the output which is called a source code which is stored in the disk.
Then comes the linker which links the object code into the system library creating a file which can be executed and then stored in the disk.
An executable file is a file that is used to perform various functions or operations on a computer. Unlike a data file, an executable file cannot be read because it has been compiled. 
Then the loader takes the executable file from the disks and stores it in the primary memory of the computer.
Then the intructions from the primary memoery is taken by the cpu and then excecuted.
