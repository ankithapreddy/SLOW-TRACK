What is stdio.h?
It is a file.
What is a file?
File is where we store information?
What information will be stored in stdio.h and where is header file?

This header contains information used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library
functions such as  printf. We explain the contents of headers in more detail in Chapter 5.

Each standard library has a corresponding header containing the function prototypes for
all the functions in that library and definitions of various data types and constants needed
by those functions.
