Why start with 
#
in the line 
#include<stdio.h>

The C preprocessor executes before a program is compiled.
There are two things C preprocessor another C compiler.

All the lines beginning with # is processed by preprocesor.
What is stdio.h?
It is a  header file.
What is a file?
File is where we store information
What information will be stored in stdio.h and where is header file?
Header files contain information needed by the compiler telling it about functions and macros not present in a .c file. By convention, they are named with a .h extention.
This header contains information used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library
functions such as  printf. We explain the contents of headers in more detail in Chapter 5.

Each standard library has a corresponding header containing the function prototypes for
all the functions in that library and definitions of various data types and constants needed
by those functions. 

What is a function? A function is a unit of code that is often defined by its role within a greater code structure.

cd stands for change directory
what is a code structure? The code structure is designed to permit easy portability to other parallel platforms as well as ease of modification for climate researchers.
know all the functions , write a new code.
Each program weâ€™ve presented has consisted of a function called 
main that called standard library functions to accomplish its tasks
what is a standard library function?
C Standard Library Functions. ... C Standard library functions or simply C Library functions are inbuilt functions in C programming. The prototype and data definitions of the functions are present in their respective header files, and must be included in your program to access them.
In computer programming, a function prototype or function interface is a declaration of a function that specifies the function's name and type signature (arity, data types of parameters, and return type), but omits the function body.
